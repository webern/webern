**Call me Matt**

**Webern**

- Q: Why a weird GitHub username?
- A: Because I made it a long time ago before I knew GitHub was important.

Anton Webern was a 12-tone composer of the *Second Viennese School*, buddies with Sch√∂nberg and Berg.
Webern DGAF and wrote tiny, short, sparse pieces,
sometimes so small you can count the notes.
Back when I was in music school, I was impressed and wrote some short, sparse pieces of my own.
